This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Greetings developement team! I have created a simple weather application for you.

I used bootstrap & Sass for UI.
Redux and axios for data & API handling.

I do have notes spread through my code to show my thought process on a select few areas I found challenging.
I kept it has minimal as possible for clean viewing. Any suggestions are welcomed! Enjoy!
