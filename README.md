This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have created a simple weather application.

Packaged manager used was yarn. Once cloned, in terminal type yarn to update dl/update packages.

I used bootstrap & Sass for UI. Compiled Sass using Live Sass Compiler.
Redux and axios for data & API handling.
