This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Greetings developement team! I have created a simple weather application for you.

Packaged manager used was yarn. Once cloned, in terminal type yarn to update dl/update packages.

I used bootstrap & Sass for UI. Compiled Sass using Live Sass Compiler.
Redux and axios for data & API handling.

I do have notes spread through my code to show my thought process on a select few areas I found challenging.
I kept it has minimal as possible for clean viewing. 

I really appreciate the time you are taking to review my code.
Any suggestions are highly welcomed and more appreciated. Enjoy!
